# perimeter of squares in a rectangle

[codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/559a28007caad2ac4e000083)

The drawing shows 6 squares the sides of which have a length of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. It's easy to see that the sum of the perimeters of these squares is : `4 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8) = 4 * 20 = 80`

Could you give the sum of the perimeters of all the squares in a rectangle when there are n + 1 squares disposed in the same manner
